Before describing this project, I want you to know that I'm a Korean and I'm not good at writing in English.

So, there will be a lot of grammar mistakes on this page.

Hope you understand this :(

OBD Data Gatherer
=================
This is an android application that can be used to gather some data through an OBD2 bluetooth module.

Currently, it's only tested on two cars:Morning(KIA) and Veracruz(Hyundai).

This app is consisted of three parts:bluetooth communicating part, interpretating car data part, printing the result part.

I used the jxl library to make the result file in the excel form, in order to use those data on the further research more easily.
